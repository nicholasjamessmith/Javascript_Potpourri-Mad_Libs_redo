//Count Odd Numbers
//Write a function named oddNumberCount which receives one argument that should be a number. The function should return how many positive odd numbers there are below the number passed into the argument.

//Step1
//Create a function named oddNumberCount which can receive a number as an argument
//const oddNumberCount = (number) => {
//  if (number % 2 === 1) {
//    let i = 0; i < number; i += 2
//  }
//  return i
//}
//console.log(oddNumberCount(7))
//Step2
//Create the conditions for returning a set of postive numbers below the number passed as argument
//Step3
//Create the conditions for returning only odd numbers
//Step4
//Connect the two conditions with proper syntax
//Step 5
//Create a return statement that produces the results of your function in a list of numbers
